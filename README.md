# Practice 1

Welcome to Unit 4, here we will begin making more interactive websites, as well as build websites able to be published. 

Use this repository as a way to practice working with html button design. Follow the steps below with the class. 

### Problem 1

Use the **button1.html** file to view different button layouts. 

### Problem 2

Using the **button2.html** file, recreate a website that looks like 

E.g.

```
=> Hello, what is your name?
David

=> Hello, David!
```

To submit, just push your code to this repository. This work will be due Friday.
